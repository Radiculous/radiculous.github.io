               <h1>Concept 2 - There’s more to share</h1>

                  <p>When coming up with an mark, there are things that we consider:</p>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Simple - The mark should be able to be drawn on a napkin</li>
                      <li>Distinct - The mark should be discernible</li>
                      <li>Appropriate - The mark should relevant to the industry that the organisation is for.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Ofcourse all these should come together and convey the brand’s (or perhaps the founder’s) personality and message.</p>

                  <h2>Brand Message: Approachable Authority</h2>

                  <p>After our initial call, there were a few words that were constantly popping up, in that the instructors didn’t take themselves too seriously despite the fact that they were top of their class.</p>

                  <p>Enduro Biking takes a lot of technical skill to learn, but while so, the main crux of it is to enjoy the ride.</p>

                  <p>We wouldn’t go as far to say it’s “fun” —but it is enjoyable.</p>

                  <p>And that’s what the EAP team imagines this brand to be, enjoyable at the same time empower you to have the skillset to maximize your machine.</p>

                  <p>EAP while being a team of highly competent instructors, want to instill an environment that’s casual and relaxed.</p>

                  <p>It’s already difficult to weld a huge machine between your legs and it’s only right to have instructors that will guide you but also let you explore and figure things out for yourself.</p>

                  <p>When you sign up for a course on EAP you’re not just signing up for a class, you’re signing in to a new set of friends.</p>

               <h2>Logomark</h2>

                  <p>Our logomark is based on mountain trenches and the outdoors. We wanted to create something less edgy, less in-your-face, and more steady, casual but at the same time, firm.</p>

                  <p>We ride until the sun goes down —or until the sunrises.</p>

                  <p>The scenery also forms a helmet that is most often used when riding enduro bikes.</p>

                  <p>The mark can stand on its own —as seen but can also be paired with the Futura Bold (our typeface of choice)</p>


               <h3>Typography</h3>

                  <p>Typography is an important component in establishing how we present our brand to the public. If the mark is the face of the company then, typography is its voice.</p>

                  <p>We chose Futura Bold as our main typeface for the mark because it’s a worker’s typeface.

                    <p>The sharp edges and rounded bowls of the R and O evoke friendliness without being a push over.</p>

                    <p>It’s easy to read, and works well in smaller sizes because of the strong silhouette of the letterforms.</p>

                    <p>It’s robust, just like our bikes, and moreso our instructors.

                    <p>And it ties in well with our sturdy mark.</p>

               <h2>Color Scheme </h2>

                    <p>The mark is our face.</p>

                    <p>The typeface is our voice.</p>

                    <p>The colors are our clothes. </p>

                    <p>Correspondence with the founders were firm that they wanted to drive the point that this is a Filipino-owned and run organization, now how can we depcit that without appearing too Filipino-flag-ey.</p>

                      <p>We take inspiration from outdoor brands like Patagnonia and Northface and peruse a slightly varied saturation of Red, Blue and Yellow. </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Tying everything together, we have a mark encompasses ‘Approachable Authority’. </p>

                <p>As mentioned earlier, a strong mark should have 3 things</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Simple — our mark is simple enough that it works with our without color, There’s no need to think about what it means because it’s right there.</li>
                  <li>Distinct — Unlike most brands under this category, we take a more calmer take and less rugged but at the same time we still show our sporty side</li>
                  <li>Appropriate — The mark is very much sporty but also is inclusive.</li>
                </ol>

          <h1>Santa Marina Water - Clean Service</h1>

           <img src="img/01.png">

           <p></p>

            <p>Embarking on this project, the question: How do you brand water? Something commmoditized, something necessary for life? kept bouncing around.</p>

            <p>Utilities don’t need branding, because once you’re in, you don’t have much of a choice. </p>

            <p>But then I remembered something that Marty Neumier said: A brand is something that people say about you when you’re not in the room.</p>

            <p>A brand is a reputation.</p>

            <p>If that’s the case, then the project shifts from marketing a product, to marketing the distributor.</p>

            <h3>Service from the heart (buong puso kaming tutulong)</h3>

            <p>When everyone sells the <em>same thing,</em> how do you differentiate?</p>

           <img src="img/03.png">

            <p>better? —better how?</p>

            <p>faster?</p>

            <p>cheaper?</p>

            <p>If you’re going for the “ERs” what are you <em>really offering</em>?</p>

            <p>I say, The <strong>ultimate</strong> differentiator is <strong>service</strong>. </p>

            <h3>Everything is service.</h3>

           <img src="img/04.png">

            <p>No matter what you sell be it paper, computers, or even planes! at the end of it day, you’re not selling, you're providing a service.</p>

            <p>People buy from people.</p>

            <p>Every transaction is service. From submitting the proposal, to delivering the product, to fixing the product.</p>

            <p>We are all at everyone’s service, no matter how you look at it.</p>

           <img src="img/05.png">

            <p>Better service means better reputation and the best brands have the best reputation. The product is a reminder of the service provided. —yes even if it’s a commodity like water.</p>

            <p>While water doesn’t need any marketing or branding, the providers do.</p>

            <p>I bet I can ask you who the better water providers are and you wouldn’t bat on naming a few.</p>

            <p>What makes them different? Is it the water that they provide? </p>

            <p>No. </p>

            <p>It’s the service that they provide. The better ones are consistent, accommodating and most of all, helpful.</p>

            <p>The not-so-better ones? well, you know what they don’t have.</p>

            <p>Even if they are providng the same end product, the transaction feels different.</p>

            <p>And that’s where Santa Marina Water (SMW) will differentiate.</p>

            <p>SMW believes that the only way to create meaningful change is thru <em>clean service</em>. </p>

            <h2>Clean Service.</h2>

            <p>What is clean service?</p>

           <img src="img/06.png">

            <p>Clean service means your product is of high standard and of best quality, clean service means you hear your customers, you know your customers. </p>

            <p>You are your customer.</p>

            <p>Empathy, Listening and Conversing with the town, You’re honest, down-to-earth, approachable.</p>

            <p>People don’t want to talk to brands, people to talk to people.</p>

            <p>SMW is a company that prioritizes empathy, listening and compassion —SMW believes that good service harkens its roots to these 3 traits.</p>

            <p>Why you ask? </p>

           <img src="img/07.png">

            <p>To build meaningful and deeper relationships you need to listen to the person, empathise with their situation and advise with compassion.</p>

            <p>That’s how you deepen bonds.</p>

            <p>Because we don’t just focus on providing you with running water, we also want to get to know you.</p>

            <p>Santa Marina believes the ways of the past is the way to ensure an abundant future.</p>

            <p>Santa Marina has 1 foot in the future but has never forgotten the value of making sure that the traditional way of doing things can be better and durable.</p>

            <p>&lt;Show water company branding —stale, uninspired, &gt;</p>

            <h2>Branding Concept</h2>

           <img src="img/08.png">

            <p>Listening is a superpower. </p>

            <p>When you listen, you learn. you gain insight, you connect.</p>

            <p>The visual identity focuses on the core principle: Listenning and making sure that you’re <strong>Heard</strong>.</p>

            <p>We’ve reach the pinnacle of communication. —Today’s technology enables us to disseminate information with the speed of thought. In an instant, we can reach millions, <em>but we can also be reached by millions in turn. </em></p>

            <p>And that can be overwhelming.</p>

            <p>How do we handle such an influx of information? </p>

            <p>We slow down, we listen, we empathise, we advise.</p>

            <p>Listening starts the relationship, Listening builds.</p>

            <p>It’s an often over-looked portion of the whole customer’s journey, because it’s easier to ignore and shrug off.</p>

            <p>We have time and we’ll make time for you. All the while providing you with the service that you need.</p>

            <p>Service is what people remember you by. The product is a souvenir of the service. </p>

           <img src="img/09.png">

            <h2>Aiming to make things better.</h2>

            <p>Santa Marina Water —aims to make things just a little different, just a little better. </p>

            <p>We hear you, we care.</p>

            <h2>The Mark : We hear you, and we care.</h2>

            <p>The mark is timeless, iconic, distinctive in an unobfuscated, unobtrusive mark, it’s a simple shape made up of even simpler components.</p>

            <p>We want our mark to be familiar, simple and recognizable. </p>

            <p>The mark is a combination of the following: </p>

           <img src="img/11.png">

            <p>Ears - to listen for empathy</p>

            <p>Waterdrops - to remind our customers of the tangible product that we’re providing</p>

            <p>heart - because combined it shows the care that we have to our customers that we are always looking out for them.</p>

            <p>forming a Heart —symbolising compassion, nourishment and care.</p>

           <img src="img/12.png">

            <h2>The Typeface : Bouba by HVD </h2>

            <p>If the mark is how a brand is identified and the typeface is how it’s heard.</p>

            <p>Words are percieved differently when set in different typefaces.</p>

            <p>Example:</p>

           <img src="img/13.png">

            <p>From the HVD Website: </p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Bouba Round is more than it seems on first sight. It combines the best of two worlds, having an expressive character with its round and friendly shapes and performing great in every typographic aspect. The type family is a true workhorse, ready for serious typography. </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>We want our voice to be unique and be discernible apart fromt other providers, we want to be distinct but not incomprehensible.</p>

            <p>Bouba’s shapes are unique enough but not too different that legibility is sacrificed. </p>

            <p>Bouba strikes a great balance of approachable and credibility round edges, and soft curves.</p>

           <img src="img/14.png">

            <h3>Why Rounded Typeface?</h3>

            <p>Rectangles with rounded corners are easier on the eyes than a rectangle with sharp edges because they take less cognitive effort to visually process.</p>

            <h2>Color Palette </h2>

            <p>If the typography is our voice, then the color palette is the clothing. </p>

           <img src="img/15.png">

            <p>Vibrant, fresh and energetic are themes that were explored when conceptualising the color scheme.</p>

            <p>We are striving for a brand that’s captivating but at the same time not overpowering. </p>

            <p>Ocean blues, Sky blues plus accents of Lime Green and Flashy Purples give the brand a calm and vibrant vibe. It’s clean, fresh, young —optimistic and full of energy.</p>

           <img src="img/16.png">

            <h2>Composing the brand logo</h2>

            <p>The lockup will have both the name and the mark at all times for the timebeing —that is until we are properly introduced to our customers and investors. </p>

            <p>Our brand is a symbol that we wear our hearts on our sleeves, and that’s our superpower, we empathise, we’re compassionate and more importantly we care —for you. </p>

            <p>The mark is a reminder not just for our customers but also to us that in everything we do, it’s the service that matters.</p>

           <img src="img/17.png">

            <h2>Mockups</h2>

            <p>Here are a few samples of how the branding will work in different applications like road signs, billing, uniforms and the water meter:</p>

            <h4>Shirt Uniforms</h4>

           <img src="img/18.png">

           <h4>Water Meter</h4>

           <img src="img/19.png">

           <h4>Road Signages</h4>

           <img src="img/20.png">

          <h4>Billing</h4>

           <img src="img/21.png">
