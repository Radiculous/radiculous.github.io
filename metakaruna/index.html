          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>The current range of herbal supplement drinks' (e.g. slimming teas) packaging all have one thing in common. </p>

          <img src="img/problem.png" alt="Images of 'Slimming' Tea">

          <p>No, it is not the color nor the sexy lady on the box. </p>

          <p>It is the bad typography, unpolished logo and look and the sub-par quality packaging that all add up and make the product untrustworthy and suspicious.  The apperance  makes these products no different from those ‘magical snake blood’ and other alternative medicines that are labelled as ‘wonder drugs’.</p>
          <p>Walk through the aisles of groceries and you are greeted with an onslaught of colors, packaging and marketing. Every product is trying to sell themselves to you, which many believe that the brighter the packaging the higher chance one captures buyer's attention.  Sometimes if you are lucky, you even get a person who does a hard-sell and lets you actually sample the product. </p>
          <p>Try hard as we may, but consumers do judge a book by the cover. That is how they choose. They choose with their eyes and their emotions.   </p>

          <p>In the world of alternative medicinal teas  the mentioned general packaging/appearance must be modified to address the issue of trustworthiness.  A different take on the image will speak both to the believers and the skeptics.</p>
          <p>The subsequent concepts that I shall present to you aim to present <b
	          >Meta Karuna</strong> Herbal Dietary Tea/Herbal Laxative Tea as a <strong>superior, trustworthy and most of all <i>safe</i> </strong> product.</p>

               <h2>The Power of Threes</h2>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/intro.png"></p>

               <p>Good things come in 3’s. Moe, Larry and Curly, Huey, Duey and Louie, Father, Son and Holy Spirit and the list goes on.</p>

               <p>Meta Caruna is <i>also</i> comprised of 3 main herbs : </p>
               <ul>
               	<li>Senna Seeds</li>
               	<li>Uproot Ladybell</li>
               	<li>Purple rhizome yam</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>The Symbol Deconstructed</h3>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/01.png"></p>

               <p>It is no coincidence that our logo has three major parts. These 3 leaves represent the 3 main ingredients of **Meta Karuna**.</p>

               <p>The identical shape of the three represents:  water, a feather, and a leaf:</p>

               <ul>
               	<li>Water to represent cleanliness and purity</li>
               	<li>Feather to represent lightness and ease</li>
               	<li>Leaf to represent nature and freshness</li>
               </ul>

               <p>We distill the values of **Meta Karuna** into a succinct symbol, which at a glance can illicit confidence and trust.</p>

               <h3>The Symbol — Combined</h3>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/02.png"></p>

               <p>When we combine the shapes, we come up with something totally different. When combined, the individual shapes become more than just the sum of its parts.  In parallel to <strong>Meta Karuna</strong>, individually the 3 herbs are beneficial on their own. and when combined they give you sense of balance. The tea not only helps in relaxation but also aids in overall digestion. One of the key benefits is its immediate remedy for constipation. Thus, it cleans your body;  makes you feel light and not bloated; and freshens your whole being.  </p>

               <p>The 3 herbs are beneficial on their own and when combined, they give you a sense of balance or harmony within</p>

               <h2>Typeface</h2>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/03.png"></p>

               <p>We choose Museo as our typeface because of its serifs. Museo has its serifs covering only 1/2 of the stems of letters, which look a lot like leaves on twigs. Its particularly earthy nature makes it the perfect typeface for <strong>**Meta Karuna**.</strong> </p>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/04.png"></p>


               <p>Museo also has a particularly wide en-width and quite a high x-height, which makes it very readable. Museo's rounded feature makes it a typeface that is approachable, friendly and credible.</p>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/05.png"></p>

               <h3>One more thing...</h3>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/threes/06.png"></p>

               <p>Yes, the thing in the middle is a tea bag. ;)</p>

				<h2>Concept 2 : Light as a Feather</h2>


				<p align="center"><img src="img/feather/intro.jpg"></p>

				<p><strong>Meta Karuna</strong> Herbal Dietary Tea/Laxative Tea aims to help individual with sudden bout of constipation. Whenever we are constipated, we feel heavy, bloated and most of all, <strong>toxic</strong>.</p>

				<p>Constipation is a simple problem that <strong>Meta Karuna</strong> dietary herbal tea can relieve. <strong>Meta Karuna</strong> is a laxative and an effective one at that.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Regular bowel movement should not be a pain in the a**. </p>

				<p>When we have regular bowel movement, we feel light, light as a feather.</p>

				<h3>The Symbol</h3>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/feather/01.png" alt="" /></p>

				<p>How light? This light. Jumping-so-high-light. We derive our symbol from this energetic and happy form and integrate it into our name.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Positioning it in the center of the name drives the point home. Meta Karuna’s main concern is <strong>YOU</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Feel light and easy with <strong>Meta Karuna.</strong></p>

				<p>Because after all, this <em>is</em> the essence of <strong>Meta Karuna</strong>, right?</p>


				<h3>The Logo</h3>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/feather/02.png" alt="" /></p>

				<p>But having a strong icon to represent the brand is not enough. We support our symbol by providing a compatible typographical treatment.</p>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/feather/03.png" alt="" /></p>

				<p>The handmade lettering has an organic appeal and is fluid. Handmade lettering humanizes the brand. We make the brand approachable and relatable. Like a good friend, we personify the brand. Thereby making the products associated with the brand more trustworthy.</p>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/feather/03a.png" alt="" /></p>

				<h3>Typeface</h3>

               <p align="center"><img src="img/feather/04.png" alt="" /></p>

				<p>The supporting typeface that we will use with the logo to complete the identity is Tisa Pro.</p>

				<p>To contrast with the spontaneity of the logomark, Tisa Pro is a very organized and highly systematic typeface. Extremely readable at the same time being very reliable typeface, I see no other perfect typeface for the mark.</p>
