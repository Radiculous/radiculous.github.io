				<h1>Takels Entertainment - ❤ Videos</h1>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/02.jpg"/></figure>
				
				<p>Video is a later innovation as form of media with only having been around for a little less than a century, but has undergone massive changes the way we consume it. </p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/03.jpg"/></figure>			

				<p>Video was a communal experience thru big galas, premiers it was certainly an event. It was the only way for anyone to be able to view video. </p>
				
				<p>The invention of the Television changed the &quot;how&quot; we viewed video. </p>
				

				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/04.jpg"/></figure>

				
				<p>Videos which started as film; big screens that immersed viewers into the world of the story; to now, with tiny computers in our pockets, we can now consume exceptionally produced videos anytime, anywhere.</p>
				
				<p>No matter how we consume video, what captivates the audience are the story and the emotional connection.</p>
				
				<p>It is the content and the story that tie it together.</p>
				
				<p>The democritization of technology brought about a shift in consumption habits. Video became ubiquitous. </p>

				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/05.jpg"/></figure>
				
				<p>Video has become the preferred way to consume content, and news. Bandwidth has become more affordable and several channels have opened up. </p>
	
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/video-site-logos.png"/></figure>			
				
				<p>We have Netflix, Vimeo, Youtube, Instagram Stories, IGTV, Snapchat, Facebook Videos (to name a few) —technology has enabled what used to be an event for the privileged to a necessity for the general public.</p>
				
				<p>We live in a wonderful time because more than ever, more and more people are craving for content, and the best way to gain attention and much engagement is through video, which is literally a red button away.</p>
				
				<p>They say a picture paints a thousand words, but imagine how you much you can say with 24 frames / second?</p>
				
				<p>Video is a visual, aural and emotional hodgepodge. Several components come into play to produce only the best and/or relevant content.</p>
				
				<h2>The Concept</h2>
				
				<p>We wanted the Takels Brand to be perceived as smart, bold and uncompromising.</p>
				
				<p>Production houses would use clichè icons to depict who they are</p>
				
				<p>Through either a video camera, a play button, or a film reel. </p>
				
				<p>While succinct and effective, one can get lost in all the video cameras, film reels when placed together. </p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/prodhouse-logos.jpg"/></figure>
				
				<p>A pictogram while an effective way to communicate at a glance, still requires a bit of decoding to be effective.</p>
				
				<p>We want the Takels Entertainment identity to evoke video but not scream it. </p>
				
				<p>We want the video reference to be subtle. We would also pay homage to its previous mark that was a non-descript version of the color bars. </p>
				
				<p>While an obvious pictogram could spell your services out, it is the character and vision of the company that should take precedence. </p>
				
				<p>Extensive research went into crafting the mark that would encompass the culture and personality of the Takels team. </p>
				
				<p>When conducting the workshop, 1 sentence stood out: </p>
				
				<blockquote>
				<p>“We Love videos”</p>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>When I heard that I knew that the mark should show the team’s love for video, video production, video consumption. </p>
				
				<p>It was only right to use this as our starting point for the mark: </p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/07.eps"/></figure>
				
				<p>Video, like water, will adapt to the container it is placed in, while some formatting restrictions may apply, generally speaking, it is all about the story.</p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/06.eps"/></figure>
				
				<p>The Takels brand plays homage to this flexibility of the medium. From the early aspect ratio of 4:3 to the present 9:16, which is a fairly recent innovation, thanks to smartphones. </p>

				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/08.png"/></figure>			
				
				<p>Perusing the 4:3 ratios of the early mid century to the current 9:16 portrait aspect. Who would have thought we will be shooting “tall” videos? It is unprecedented that we used to shoot videos in wide-screen but now industry considers shooting in “high” format as well. </p>
				
				<p>Unmoved by the ever changing world of technology, they have done production for TV, made content for the web, and have worked with traditional forms of film as well. </p>
				
				<p>Their passion for creating stories are boundless.</p>

				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/logo-reveal.png"/></figure>
				
				<p>After all, that’s what they are known for, they have prided themselves to “get” the audience and connect with them.</p>
				

				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/09.png"/></figure>

				
				<p>The letters’ width and sizes may seem arbitrary and off-beat but they’re intentionally made to be that way.</p>
							
				<p>The baseline grid to which all letters are based are the screen sizes that Takels fit into.</p>
				
				<p>The concept of the identity doesn’t play on just 1 aspect of tv production but is based on the content. </p>
				
				<p>Befitting to the concept, we use the aspect ratio as our grid to construct our whole identity system.</p>
				
				<p>Takels is adaptable so why should the mark be fixed to 1 particular size?</p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/10.JPG"/></figure>
				
				<p>The Takels team is made up of a group of highly diverse individuals 1 may be passionate about the local film industry, another, be into foreign art films while another be neck-deep into films of a particular celebrity. </p>
				
				<p>The best way to represent a group that has the chops to produce quality content is to bring that same idea to their identity. </p>
				
				<p>In a seemingly unapologetic manner, the typographical treatment doesn’t have a pattern but it does share 1 style: It’s shameless and loud, which is a perfect reflection of Takels Entertianment brand creedo- confident, bold and uncompromising. </p>
				
				<p>The identity is unorthodox but delivers their message, which illustrates the Takels team.</p>
				
				<p>Their passion for videos oozes out by the way they talk and carry themselves.</p>
				
				<p>Video and film run through every fiber of the company.</p>
				
				<p>To be a member of Takels means you have an obsession about film and video. </p>
				
				<p>That sets the baseline for everything they do. Their love for the medium is above all first and foremost.</p>
				
				<p>The bones of the whole identity rests on content, principles and delivering only the most appropriate type of content for the project.</p>
				
				<p>Where will we consume videos next? Is not relevant, the &quot;What&quot; may be different but the &quot;Why&quot; will always remain the same. </p>
				
				<p>We make videos because we want to make an emotional connection with the audience.</p>
				
				<p>We make videos because we want to make an emotional connection with the audience.</p>
				
				<h2>Typography</h2>
				
				<p>If the voice is how we speak, the typography is how we want to be heard. Every font type, every style has a corresponding voice. Takels is a collective of different, eccentric but like-minded geniuses. </p>
				
				<p>When auditioning appropriate typefaces for identity, what we look for are voice and tone. Does the typeface convey the right voice? Does it read the right way? How is the tone?</p>
				
				<p>Is it authoritative and imposing or is it sweet and subtle? Does it whisper or scream?</p>
				
				<p>All these nuances have to be considered before delving in and proposing a typeface.</p>
				
				<p>We looked through a few other foundries before settling in with Hoefler’s Knockout Family.</p>
				
				<p>When choosing typography based on different width it would help that they all come from 1 family to maintain consistency of the shapes and structure of the letterforms.</p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/11.png"/></figure>
				
				<p>Hoefler’s Knockout was chosen for the base skeleton of the logotype, it has been stretched and modified to suit the underlying grid.</p>
				
				<p>Hoefler’s Knockout packs a punch and is perfect for poster design. Knockout is based on Gothic woodtypes which existed a century before swiss Helvetica came into the scene. </p>
				
				<p>Gothic woodtypes were common to old boxing posters which used woodtype instead of metal had a certain panachè and warmth. </p>
				
				<p>Having letterforms carved out of wood offered it a certain flexibility when it came to widths. From the thin condensed to the bulkier bolds. Woodtype allows itself to be expressive without deviating much from the general form.</p>
				
				<p>The letterforms have been painstakingly tweaked, kerned and redrawn to make sure they work together harmoniously. Delivering the message, inspiring action.</p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/12.png"/></figure>
				
				<p>We tweak the letterforms and shape to fit the underlying Aspect Ratio Grid widths and kern to maintain its legibility despite the distortion.</p>
				
				<p>Of course, not all typeface family can be used vanilla, it still needs to be tweaked, pushed and pulled to suit our messaging.</p>
				
				<h2>Colors</h2>
				
				<p>Having the basic forms cemented, another layer that needs to be considered is color. </p>
				
				<p>The right form in the right color can drive the message home. </p>
				
				<p>Pop, Oomph, Impact are words that we associate with videos that engage us. </p>
				
				<p>The logo arrangement already exudes boldness and movement. It also gives us an idea of what it’s like to work with a dynamic well-rounded agency.</p>
				
				<p>We take it up a notch, because that’s what Takels is... just when you think you’ve seen it all, they manage to surprise you with something else.</p>
				
				<p>Depicting that same energy, we pepper in vibrant hues and shades to give rise to that same emotion whilst also playing homage to the former identity.</p>
				
				<figure><img src="img/lovideos/13.png"/></figure>
				
				<h2>Parting Words</h2>
				
				<p>The Identity sums up Takels : Energetic, Brazen and Smart. You don’t need to understand who they are, because you can’t. But know that when you hire them, you know you’re getting a team that loves video, and will do anything to get your message out effectively as they’re shameless, unapologetic and relentless.</p>
				
				<p>From the standard 3:4 aspect ratio for TV; 16:9 aspect ratio for cinemas; ultra wide 21:9; immersive 14:10 iMax Film; to the now “normal” portrait oriented videos of 9:16; and to 1:1 instagram videos. </p>
				
				<p>Who would have thought that there would be so many ways to consume video?</p>
				
				<p>Where will we be consuming video from in the future? No one knows but know that the device doesn’t matter because to Takels Entertainment, it’s about the story, the connection and the message. </p>
