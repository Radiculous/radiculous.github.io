				<h1>Swirl üç∑, Sniff üëÉ, Sip üòó</h1>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>To be able to enjoy a good vintage of wine, there‚Äôs a ritual that both wine connoisseurs and afficionados partake: </p>

				<p>It‚Äôs the 3Ss:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Swirl</strong> - you aerate the glass to make sure that the wine in the glass gets enough oxygen to highlight the flavors.
					</li>

					<figure><img src="img/sss/01.png"/></figure>

					<li><strong>Sniff</strong> - Once done with the swirling you take a whif of the vintage to be able to ‚Äútaste‚Äù the vintage -after all 75% of the taste is in the smell.
					</li>

					<figure><img src="img/sss/02.png"/></figure>

					<li><strong>Sip</strong> - You bring the glass to your lips and sip. Only then can the amalgamation of all these can you appreciate the intricacies and nuances of a good wine vintage.
					</li>

					<figure><img src="img/sss/03.png"/></figure>

				</ul>
				<p>It‚Äôs the same ritual no matter what the vintage the bottle.</p>

				<h2>The Concept</h2>

				<p>The logomark's concept is a visualization of the ritual of enjoying a bottle of wine, from opening to finally getting a taste.</p>

				<figure><img src="img/sss/04.png"/></figure>

				<p>On first glance we see a wine glass because Project Vino is first and foremost a portal to curated vintages, it‚Äôs befitting to have a mark that identifies what its all about without obfuscation. </p>

				<figure><img src="img/sss/05.png"/></figure>

				<p>But ‚òùüèª here‚Äôs where the mark gets interesting.</p>

				<p>When we break down the intricate parts we see that the sum is greater than the parts. </p>

				<p>The swirl represents the first step. </p>

				<figure><img src="img/sss/06.png"/></figure>

				<p>The container is like the vessel, which is an abstraction of the nose lastly,  non-obvious fact is how it curves outwards representing how we enjoy the wine ‚Äîthe smile --the savor.</p> üëáüèª

				<h2>Typography</h2>

				<p>If the voice is how we speak, the typography is how we want to be heard. Every font type, every style has a corresponding voice. </p>

				<p>When auditioning appropriate typefaces for identity, what we look for are voice and tone. Does the typeface convey the right voice? Does it read the right way? How is the tone?</p>

				<p>Is it authoritative and imposing or is it sweet and subtle? Does it whisper or scream?</p>

				<p>All these nuances have to be considered before delving in and proposing a typeface.</p>

				<p>We looked through a few other foundries before settling in with Hoefler‚Äôs Sentinel</p>

				<figure><img src="img/sss/10.png"/></figure>

				<p>Slab-serifs were seen as a oddity in the back in the day as it is perhaps one of the more difficult lettersets to typeset. Slabserifs‚Äô main purpose was for it to be used only as a display type, its limited use made it a peculiarity amongst designers and typesetters alike.</p>

				<p>Enter Sentinel gives this obscure genre of typeface new life by bringing it to the modern era, democritising it, and giving it the italics and book weight that it deserves.</p>

				<p>Sentinel is the slab-serif for everyone. </p>

				<figure><img src="img/sss/11.png"/></figure>

				<p>From an obscure and hard to use typeface to a democritised version that everyone can use, from text, to display headers. </p>

				<p>From the Hoefler Co. Website:</p>

				<quote>Unbound by the traditional limitations of the Antique and Clarendon styles, Sentinel is a fresh take on a familiar and practical typographic genre. A well-rounded family with clear and expressive gestures, the self-possessed Sentinel is practical at small sizes and engaging at large ones.</quote>

				<quote>Sentinel was designed to address the many shortcomings of the classical slab serif. Unbound by traditions that deny italics, by technologies that limit its design, or by ornamental details that restrict its range of weights, Sentinel is a fresh take on this useful and lovely style, offering for the first time a complete family that‚Äôs serviceable for both text and display. </quote>

				<p>The parallels of Sentinel, the Slab Serif Genre to Project Vino is uncanny. The goal is to eliminate the stigma that wine appreciation is an intimidating hobby and one must have a sophisticated palatte to enjoy a vintage. </p>

				<p>Sentinel‚Äôs characteristics evoke approachability (the rounded Os, Ns, Cs and lowercase 2-storey As), while at the same time giving it gravitas and authority without being intimidating. The curves make this typeface a joy to look at illicits confidence in every word.</p>

				<h2>Cheers!</h2>

				<figure><img src="img/sss/12.png"/></figure>

				<p>Combining the logomark and Sentinel we have a marriage of contrasts. The linework give the logo refinement.  Its abstraction isn‚Äôt too much that it becomes ambiguous. </p>

				<p>A bold and sturdy typeface grounds the identity and keeps it from drifing away. </p>

				<p>The heavy typeface paired with the sleek mark play off each other gives the mark an excellent flow and balance.</p>


				<p>The Identity sums up Project Vino : Relatable, Refined, Knowledgable, Curious and Interested. The identity isn't complex when you first look at it, it's unintimidating. It's understandable and it makes sense.</p>

				<p>But just like fine wine, the more you spend time, get to know and examine, you'd soon see underneath the simplicity lies complexity and depth --exactly like fine wine.</p>

				<p>As you start your wine journey with Project Vino, they become your guide and your mentor to the big world of wineyou're assured that you'll be well taken care of and you're sure to enjoy all the discoveries that you will be making along the way.</p>

				<p>Project Vino: Where your journey begins.</p>

				<p>An easter egg:ü•ö</p>

				<p>Convergiing into the tittle of the J to represent that every wine <strong>j</strong>>ourney begins with project vino.</p>
