              <h1>And What?</h1>

              <p>How do you symbolize creativity? </p>

              <p>How do you represent imagination?</p>

              <p>To find something that best represent a company that is geared towards the cultivation of originality requires deep understanding on what it means to create, to be original and to be unique. </p>

              <p>What does company stand for?</p>

              <p>We need determine how the company wants to be viewed and seen, how it wants to be recognized.</p>

              <p>What better way to represent an complex idea than to use something so simple and succinct like an ampersand (&amp;)?</p>

			  <h3>The Designer's Darling</h3>

			  <p>Have you ever wondered where all these ampersand ephemora come from?</p>

              <p><img src="img/01.png" alt=""></p>

              <p>Why of all things to draw, the ampersand has always been the choice of designers?</p>

              <p>Ask any creative professional what the most fun glyph  to draw and without a doubt say that the ampersand is their favorite. </p>

              <blockquote>“usually a tirelessly entertaining one, perhaps an uncle with too many tricks,” </blockquote>

              <p><img src="img/02.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3055622/why-designers-love-the-ampersand">Co. Design Writes:</p>

              <blockquote>For type designers and aficionados both, it isn’t so much a character as it is a character, “usually a tirelessly entertaining one, perhaps an uncle with too many tricks,” as Simon Garfield wrote in his 2012 book, Just My Type.</blockquote>

              <p>Jonathan Hoefler, Type Designer : </p>

              <blockquote> “It’s always an opportunity for adventure,” he says. “Even the most conservative typefaces can give sanctuary to a whimsical ampersand or two.”</blockquote>

              <p>The (&) It’s such an expressive letter. It gives designers and creative people alike a perpetual playground to play around with. </p>

              <p>The ampersands doesn’t have any particular form instead a basic idea of how it looks (and functions) is mostly implied by the curves and it’s structure.</p>

              <p>Which is why the main focus of our mark is this playful and whimsical glyph.</p>

              <h3>(&) : A History Lesson</h3>

              <p>Commonly known as “and”, the ampersand got its visual representation from the phrase “and, per se and”.</p>

              <img src="img/03.jpg" alt="">

              <p>The graphical shorthand for “et” in latin or “and” the ampersand connotes creativity, building on the present. </p>

              <h3>And then? </h3>

              <p>Wikipedia defines “Yes and…” Thinking as: </p>

              <blockquote>Yes, and…” —more commonly referred to as the “Yes, and…” thinking is a rule of thumb in improvisational comedy (improv) which suggests that a participants should accept what another participant has stated and *expand* on that line of thinking. </blockquote>

              <p>This line of thinking is also used in business and other organizations to facilitate a more effective brainstorming of ideas and can even foster better communication and a free sharing of ideas.</p>

              <p>We define creativity as putting 2 unseemingly dissimilar and far fetched ideas and mashing them into 1 cohesive thought or product.</p>

              <p>It’s 1 <strong>and</strong> 1.</p>

              <p>Not 1 <strong>or</strong>the other</p>

              <p>“And” —is the catalyst.</p>

              <p>Papermo & co is a company that thrives on the creativity of their customers, providing the tools and products that inpsire and encourage imagination, it is only befitting that such a company be represented by a mark that is in-line with their vision.</p>

              <p><img src="img/04.gif" alt=""></p>

              <h3>Uniquely Un-unique</h3>

              <p>Technically, no one can ever claim copyright to the ampersand, which makes it public domain and is open to numerous interpretations.</p>

			  <p><img src="img/05.gif" alt=""></p>

              <p>There’s a reason why these top creative agencies use the ampersand as a symbol for their logo mark. It is both easily recognizable yet, easily customizable.</p>

              <p><img src="img/ampersandlogo.png"></p>

              <p>There’s a saying that there’s a hundred ways to skin a cat, well, there’s a hundred ways to draw a ampersand, too.</p>

			  <p><img src="img/06.png" alt=""></p>

			  <p>Papermo and Co’s offering, it’s what you do with it that matters. What Papermo and Co is offering is essentially a blank canvas, everyone and anyone can make one, it’s common. It’s paper, but what makes it unique, and what makes it *yours* is what you do with it.</p>

			  <p>It’s how you can make it yours is that what counts.</p>

			  <h3>Paper Folding</h3>

			  <p>If we stopped with the simple ampersand would have been more than enough to symbolize a company that’s creatively driven.</p>

              <p><img src="img/strips.jpg" alt=""></p>

			  <p>But we take the idea 1 step further.</p>

              <p><img src="img/papersand.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>We add another dimension to the mark by constructing it out of a single sheet of paper which is the core of crafting. </p>

              <h3>Typography</h3>

              <p>We start with a sheet of paper, and we venture out from there, where it leads us no one knows.</p>

              <h2>Logo Construction : The Mark and the Box</h3>

              <p>The juxtaposition of the round and flair of the ampersand contrasts nicely with the rigidity of the square. </p>

              <p>A typeface is essentially the company&apos;s voice. So choosing the right typeface is essentially selecting the company&apos;s voice. Too loud and the company might appear desperate, too soft, and the company might look weak. The right balance of tone and look should be struck.</p>

              <p><img src="img/09.png"></p>

              <p>Our mark combines the “P” of Papermo and the “C” of Company melded together as the ever so iconic ampersand.</p>

              <p><img src="img/10.png"></p>

              <p>The square reqpresnts the blank canvas and the mechanical side of the business while the ampersand represent the human touch and warmth, make the mark more appealing and approachable.</p>

              <h3>The Ideal Typeface</h3>

              <p><img src="img/11.png"></p>

              <p>	Ideal Sans by Jonathan Hoefler was chosen to be the acoompanying typeface for the mark because it’s a tyepface that has the fludity and warmth of a handmade typeface and while at the same time having the precision and consistency only a machine can do..</p>


			  <p>Deeply rooted in the classical forms the typeface is a trailblazer as being the first to have humanist qualities. </p>

			  <p>Ideal Sans is the ideal typeface as it also is a mix of machine precisision melded with humanist warmth.</p>
