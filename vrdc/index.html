              <h1>Open Doors, Open Opportunities</h1>

              <h2>Concept</h2>

              <p><img src="img/opendoors/door-main.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>An open door makes a movement or passage easier for a person. Symbolically, it is an invite for something to happen or to allow something new to begin.</p>

              <p>It is only appropriate to use such a powerful symbol as a jumping off point for our concept.</p>

              <p>Doors symbolize opportunity. </p>

              <p>Doors symbolize a fresh start. </p>

              <p>Doors symbolize endless possibilities.</p>

              <p>Before that first handshake, before drafting that agreement, we open doors.</p>

              <p><img src="img/opendoors/doors-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <h2>A New Hope</h2>

              <p><strong>VRDC</strong> is not just your average realty development company. <strong>VRDC</strong> wants to focus not only in creating excellent infrastructures, it is also looking at building relationships, improving lives whether it may be some place where you can start anew or just another investment opportunity. <strong>VRDC</strong> makes sure that in whatever project it undertakes, the project is the customer and improving the quality of not only their life, but also their environment.</p>

              <img src="img/opendoors/logo.jpg" alt="">

              <h2>The Symbol</h2>

              <p><img src="img/opendoors/doors-01.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>There are 2 doors that represent two perspectives that both open to opportunities whether for the person behind the door or the one coming right in.  </p>

              <p>First perspective, opening away represents VRDC opening the doors to its customers. VRDC finds and looks out for a suitable location to develop, then "opens it up".</p></p>

              <p>VRDC can open all the doors, but without the customer's appreciation, it will not be too worthwhile. THIS leads us to the 2nd perspective â€” door being pushed inward, which is the customer walking in and becoming a 'partner'.</p>

              <p>Getting to an amicable agreement is a 2-step process: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>The initial pitch (opening the door).</li>
                <li><p>The signing (walking in).</p></li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Typography</h2>

              <h3>Primary Typeface : Gotham Bold</h3>

              <p>Communication relies not only on the message said, but <em>how</em> we say it. To be a successful communicator, the medium and the message should be in agreement. We can say what we want to say but if the medium is not effective, our message will get lost in the noise.</p>

              <p>A typeface is essentially the company&apos;s voice. So choosing the right typeface is essentially selecting the company&apos;s voice. Too loud and the company might appear desperate, too soft, and the company might look weak. The right balance of tone and look should be struck.</p>

              <img src="img/opendoors/gotham.jpg" alt="">

              <p><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/"  target="_new"><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/" target"_new">Gotham Bold</a> by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones</a> was chosen as our primary typeface for its modern look and how it emulates stability and strength. <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/" target"_new">Gotham Bold</a> is a typeface used by the Barack Obama campaign, too.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/" target"_new">Gotham Bold</a> is firm without being too bossy. It is stable without being too stiff. It is assertive without being too imposing. Its hard lines are balanced with its perfect circles. It is a typeface that is most suited for the urban setting.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/" target"_new">Gotham Bold</a> is thick and mono-stroked (1 width), making it easily recognizable from a distance. Gotham looks great when enlarged. It was actually designed to be used in signages that are large enough to be viewed and read from a distance.</p>

              <p>A real estate developer should emmulate these 3 things. Stability, Strength and Security which Gotham is perfect for.</p>

              <h3>Secondary Typeface : Tungsten</h3>

              <img src="img/opendoors/tungsten.jpg" alt="">

              <p>Tungsten was used as our secondary typeface, another typeface from HF&amp;J, Tungsten was chosen for its slender and sleek form. It compliments Gotham&apos;s wider em-width.</p>

              <p>Though Tungsten can hold its own as a display font, Tungsten also is an excellent support typeface. Given that its form is so sleek and slender, juxtaposing it alongside Gotham makes Gotham even more powerful and makes all the more noticeable.</p>

              <h2>Something Extra</h2>

              <p><img src="img/opendoors/chevron.jpg"></p>

              <p>It is no accident that the encompassing shape is a chevron that is pointed upwards suggesting progress.</p>

              <p>Building towards progress, that is.</p>

            <article id="brick-by-brick" class="tab-pane rationale">

              <h1>Brick by Brick</h1>

              <h2>Concept</h2>

              <p><img src="img/build/build-main.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. How do you construct a remarkable infrastructure? One brick at a time. How do you build a lasting relationship? One handshake at a time. </p>

              <p><img src="img/build/illustration.gif" alt=""></p>

              <p>We live in a world where fast is always considered better. Everything was supposed to be done yesterday. Efficiency is a common theme. Trying to shave off a few seconds here and there was common practice and is considered good because time is money. The less time we spend doing one thing is more time spent on doing another. There are things that can benefit from this. But building quality products and trust don&apos;t. Some things take time. </p>

              <p>Taking extra time does not equate to inefficiency. Sometimes, it means planning out every detail. It is not just shaving a few minutes here and there, it&apos;s actually spending it wisely and carefully. </p>

              <p>We avoid errors so that, in turn, we avoid wasting time. </p>

              <p><strong>VRDC</strong> was not created strictly for profit. <strong>VRDC</strong> was conceived because it saw an opportunity to <strong>build</strong> on something for the improvement of society. In everything that <strong>VRDC</strong> plans, careful consideration has been made, be it in the environment, to the materials used and the location of the site. </p>

              <p><img src="img/build/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <h2>Symbol</h2>

              <p>The symbol helps enforce that attribute of building things. 2 square slabs on top of one another symbolize that to any sturdy high-rise, we must lay in the proper foundation. Because only then, can we construct something that is strong and stable.</p>

              <p>The 2 slabs also embody how we build towards a lasting relationship with our clients and future investors. Trust and integrity are our common themes.</p>

              <p>The overlapping suggests the actual building. It&apos;s dynamic and yet stable, much like how <strong>VRDC</strong> approaches its projects. <strong>VRDC</strong> makes sure that in all endeavors they pursue, there is always something that pushes the business upward.</p>

              <h2>Typeface</h2>

              <h3>Primary Typeface : Idlewild</h3>

              <p><img src="img/build/idlewild.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>As mentioned previously, if words are our message, then typography is the voice. </p>

              <p><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview/" target="_new">Idlewild</a> (also by HF&amp;J) was chosen not only because of its contemporary design but also for its width. Our symbol is chunky and heavy. It was only right to choose a typeface that would have the same visual weight as our symbol.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview/" target="_new">Idlewild</a> has an industrious look and feel. It has been designed with precision and accuracy in mind, like a well balanced knife and a well-engineered machine. Hoefler-Frere and Jones describe Idlewild as:</p>

              <blockquote>That rarest of type families, <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview/" target="_new">Idlewild</a> is a design whose distinct personality manages to embolden, not overwhelm, its surroundings.</blockquote>

              <p><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview/" target="_new">Idlewild</a> maybe an uncommon typeface but its uniqueness is its greatest strength. The fact that it is not yet associated with any brand at the moment, makes it easy for <strong>VRDC</strong> to claim. </p>

              <h3>Secondary Typeface : Tungsten</h3>

              <p><img src="img/build/tungsten.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>Tungsten was chosen as the accompanying typeface for the reason we&apos;ve mentioned previously. Its proportion and height compliments <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/idlewild/overview/" target="_new">Idlewild</a>&apos;s width and design perfectly, completely balancing the logomark.</p>

              <h2>Something Extra</h2>

              <p><img src="img/build/build-pattern-blackandwhite.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>The logomark is not only 2 square slabs on top of each other but also <strong>V</strong> <strong>R</strong> <strong>D</strong> <strong>C</strong>.</p>

              <p><img src="img/build/vrdc.letters.jpg"></p>

              <p>It&apos;s no coincidence that it also looks like an arrow pointing upwards showing progress, yet also downwards showing that no matter how high we go, we stay grounded on our roots.</p>
