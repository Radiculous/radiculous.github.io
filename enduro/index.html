               <h1>Concept - Cross the Sunset</h1>

                  <p>When coming up with an mark, there are things that we consider:</p>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Simple - The mark should be able to be drawn on a napkin</li>
                      <li>Distinct - The mark should be discernible</li>
                      <li>Appropriate - The mark should relevant to the industry that the organisation is for.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Ofcourse all these should come together and convey the brand’s (or perhaps the founder’s) personality and message.</p>

                  <h2>Brand Message: Approachable Authority</h2>

                  <p>After our initial call, there were a few words that were constantly popping up, in that the instructors didn’t take themselves too seriously despite the fact that they were top of their class.</p>

                  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2G9LE7h5AKA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="">

                  <p>Enduro Biking takes a lot of technical skill to learn, but while so, the main crux of it is to enjoy the ride.</p>

                  <p>We wouldn’t go as far to say it’s “fun” —but it is enjoyable.</p>

                  <p>And that’s what the EAP team imagines this brand to be, enjoyable at the same time empower you to have the skillset to maximize your machine.</p>

                  <p>EAP while being a team of highly competent instructors, want to instill an environment that’s casual and relaxed.</p>

                  <p>It’s already difficult to weld a huge machine between your legs and it’s only right to have instructors that will guide you but also let you explore and figure things out for yourself.</p>

                  <img src="https://www.motopinas.com/images/posts/post11468.jpg" alt="">

                  <p>When you sign up for a course on EAP you’re not just signing up for a class, you’re signing in to a new set of friends.</p>

               <h2>Logomark</h2>

                  <img src="img/01a.jpg" alt="">

                  <p>Our logomark is based on mountain trenches and the outdoors. We wanted to create something less edgy, less in-your-face, and more steady, casual but at the same time, firm.</p>

                  <p>We ride until the sun goes down —or until the sunrises.</p>

                  <img src="img/01b.jpg" alt="">

                  <p>The scenery also forms a helmet that is most often used when riding enduro bikes.</p>

                  <p>The mark can stand on its own —as seen but can also be paired with the Futura Bold (our typeface of choice)</p>

                  <img src="img/01c.png" alt="">
                  <img src="img/02.png" alt="">

               <h3>Typography</h3>

                  <p>Typography is an important component in establishing how we present our brand to the public. If the mark is the face of the company then, typography is its voice.</p>

                  <p>We chose Futura Bold as our main typeface for the mark because it’s a worker’s typeface.

                  <img src="img/03.png" alt="">

                    <p>The sharp edges and rounded bowls of the R and O evoke friendliness without being a push over.</p>

                    <p>It’s easy to read, and works well in smaller sizes because of the strong silhouette of the letterforms.</p>

                    <p>It’s robust, just like our bikes, and moreso our instructors.

                    <p>And it ties in well with our sturdy mark.</p>

                  <img src="img/04.png" alt="">


               <h2>Color Scheme </h2>

                    <p>The mark is our face.</p>

                    <p>The typeface is our voice.</p>

                    <p>The colors are our clothes. </p>

                    <p>Correspondence with the founders were firm that they wanted to drive the point that this is a Filipino-owned and run organization, now how can we depcit that without appearing too Filipino-flag-ey.</p>

                      <img src="img/05.png" alt="">

                      <p>We take inspiration from outdoor brands like Patagnonia and Northface and peruse a slightly varied saturation of Red, Blue and Yellow. </p>


                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Tying everything together, we have a mark encompasses ‘Approachable Authority’. </p>

                <p>As mentioned earlier, a strong mark should have 3 things</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Simple — our mark is simple enough that it works with our without color, There’s no need to think about what it means because it’s right there.</li>
                  <li>Distinct — Unlike most brands under this category, we take a more calmer take and less rugged but at the same time we still show our sporty side</li>
                  <li>Appropriate — The mark is very much sporty but also is inclusive.</li>
                </ol>
